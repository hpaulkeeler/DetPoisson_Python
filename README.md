# DetPoissonPython

Randomly simulates a determinantally-thinned Poisson point process on a rectangle.

A determinantally-thinned (Poisson) point process is essentially a discrete determinantal point process whose underlying state space is a single realization of a (Poisson) point process defined on some (bounded) continuous space. This is a repulsive point process, where the repulsion depends on the kernel and average density of points. For more details, see the paper by Blaszczyszyn and Keeler[1].
